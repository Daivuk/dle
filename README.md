Dave's Layered Effects

Provide simple interface for layers and effects similar to the ones found in Photo editing programs, such as Photoshop.
This could be use for offline building of your assets, or even in real time. Examples such as: Create styled TTF fonts in real time (During loading), or outlining all your sprites in a pre-process tool.
